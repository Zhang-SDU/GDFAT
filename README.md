# GDFAT ------ Generic Differential Fault Analysis Tool    

This is a generic differential fault analysis tool.     

Here we give six examples of applied DFA attacks agains white-box implementations.    

You can use this tool to perform differential fault analysis on any white box implementation of the SM4 algorithm.    

If you have any questions, you can contact me!
